        <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2"> For many years I pursued a diverse, if unfocused education. In hindsight, I realize that everything
I learned during this time has made me a better scientist and critical thinker. From design I learned
about pattern, variety, movement, and unity and how art emerges from their interaction. I learned
visual and written communication skills and that everything is palimpsest, with meaning and
function embedded in many layers and at many scales. Studying language gave me an understanding
of the influence of perspective on meaning, and grammar taught me how function is both defined
by and creates structure. Geography was a revelation to me. Something inside me had been given
voice; the patterns that I had always seen had names and reasons, and I began to understand the
language of science. I have always been interested in the complex patterns of interrelatedness that
connect all things and geography provided me with the language to understand and explore the
linkages between these patterns.&nbsp;</p>
